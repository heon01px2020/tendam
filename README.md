**Team Members:** _Fill this in!_

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:** _Fill this in!_

**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 1)_
Team Members: Edward Yan, Heon Lee, Matthew Ji, Ria Rajesh, Ricky (Wenqi) Zhong

## Team Strengths and Weaknesses: 
### Edward Yan:
- Strength: Broad understanding of popular APIs
- Weakness: Documentation is totally incomprehensible, hates (paying) money
<br /><br />
### Heon Lee: 
- Strength: Communication; keeping promises with other students (to finish assigned tasks by an assigned date)
- Weaknesses: Not fully aware of all the tools Java has; graphic design/UI/UX
Matthew Ji:
- Strengths: Cloud-based (AWS) Services (Solutions Architect)
- Weaknesses: Traditional Backend Services (ex. PHP, SQL)
Ria Rajesh:
- Strength: starts things prior to the night before they are due
- Weaknesses: bad at testing, no prior experience with object oriented programming
Ricky Zhong:
- Strength: Quick Googler - my queries are fast and I enjoy writing documentation
- Weaknesses:
  - New to such long-term projects
  - HTML and anything that has to do with GUI (Does anyone have any artistic skills?)

## Project Idea(s): Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 1) 

### Idea 1: Matching Platform

What problem does this solve?
Apps like Tinder often leave out groups by its use of collaborative filtering to aggregate opinions; we want to make sure that everyone is equally included (wait, our app might not solve this, i.e. this might not be what our app is targeting to solve and I misunderstood the premise)
Most of these apps are geared towards dating and specifically towards dating for young adults

How does this solve the problem?
Less focus on dating, if at all
More interactive and fun

Critical features + why they’re included + challenging aspect of each feature
Minigames are a large part of it. 
More engaging, more interesting from a data perspective
Challenging because each mini-game can take time to design and produce.
Platform of each mini-game is also ambiguous as well as how they’re going to be written


### Idea 2: A social hangout location recommender
Think Trip Advisor but focus on domestic casual activities rather than catering towards international tourists. An existing app that is comparable would be something like DianPing, a social media app that in China that aggregates massive amounts of data and user opinion for use in making all kinds of “restaurant”, social hangout, shopping mall, etc. recommendations.

Problem:
Lots of people try to find places to meet and hangout with friends, but the decision making process in many places simply involves performing a google search or looking up simple terms like “restaurants” in google maps. Apps that are focused on making these recommendations as well as existing with intent to gather thousands of user comments are largely nonexistent in North America. 
Trip advisor is the only really existing app for something like that in the U.S. and Canada, but it’s for tourists and nobody wants to feel like a foreigner in their own country.

Challenges:
Integrating existing location-based APIs (like Google Maps data) and however that will work
Getting data
Making use of massive databases could pose large challenges.

Critical features:
Data
More data
Focus on user-generated reviews and images
As many filters as possible (distance, type of activity, type of food, etc.)
Machine-generated recommendations based on these factors


### Idea 3: Some kind of card or turn-based strategy game.
Some examples that come to mind to think about (disregarding the far larger scale): Sid Meier’s Civilization games, Hearthstone, Slay the Spire, Gwent

Problem: Boredom.

Challenges:
Any game, even the most basic, will feature a pretty significant non-programming component that relates to game mechanics, game design, asset production, music, and art, which we may or may not be good at.
Development platform will certainly be another issue. Is this to be made in Unity? Unity code is written in C#, which is similar to Java but not the same. Developing on an engine not all of us have experience in may also pose difficulties of its own

Features:
Not entirely sure, but likely some turn-based multiplayer strategy environment with a simple interface.
